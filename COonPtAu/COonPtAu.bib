	Abstract = {Stepped single-crystal surfaces are viewed as models of real catalysts, which consist of small metal particles exposing a large number of low-coordination sites. We found that stepped platinum (Pt) surfaces can undergo extensive and reversible restructuring when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) at pressures above 0.1 torr. Scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy studies under gaseous environments near ambient pressure at room temperature revealed that as the CO surface coverage approaches 100%, the originally flat terraces of (557) and (332) oriented Pt crystals break up into nanometer-sized clusters and revert to the initial morphology after pumping out the CO gas. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observations whereby the creation of increased concentrations of low-coordination Pt edge sites in the formed nanoclusters relieves the strong CO-CO repulsion in the highly compressed adsorbate film. This restructuring phenomenon has important implications for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.},

@article{ISI:000083924800001,
	Abstract = {{One of the prominent arguments for performing surface science studies
   have for many years been to improve and design new and better catalysts.
   Although surface science has provided the fundamental framework and
   tools for understanding heterogeneous catalysis until now there have
   been extremely few examples of actually designing new catalysts based
   solely on surface science studies. In this review, we shall demonstrate
   how a close collaboration between different fundamental disciplines like
   structural-, theoretical-and reactivity-studies of surfaces as well as a
   strong interaction with industry can have strong synergetic effects and
   how this was used to develop a new catalyst. As so often before the
   studies reviewed here were not initiated with the objective to solve a
   specific problem, but realizing that a new class of very stable
   two-dimensional alloys could be synthesized from otherwise immiscible
   metals made it possible to present a new solution to a specific problem
   in the industrial catalysis relating to methane activation in the steam
   reforming process. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas and it
   is an extremely important raw material for many large scale chemical
   processes such as production of hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol. In the
   steam reforming process methane and water are converted into a mixture
   of mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the so-called synthesis gas.
   Industrially the steam reforming process usually takes place over a
   catalyst containing small nickel crystallites highly dispersed on a
   porous support material like aluminum/magnesium oxides in order to
   achieve a high active metal area. There is a general consensus that the
   rate limiting step of this process is the dissociative sticking of
   methane on the nickel surface. Driven by the desire to understand this
   step and hopefully be able to manipulate the reactivity, a large number
   of investigations of the methane/nickel interaction have been performed
   using nickel single crystals as model catalysts. The process has been
   investigated, both under thermal conditions and by using supersonic
   molecular beams elucidating the dynamical aspects of the interaction.
   The results obtained will be reviewed both with respect to the clean and
   modified nickel surfaces. Especially the two-dimensional gold-nickel
   alloy system will be considered since the fundamental results here have
   lead to the invention of a new nickel based catalyst, which is much more
   resistant to carbon formation than the conventional nickel catalysts.
   This may be one of the first examples of how fundamental research can
   lead to the invention of new catalysts. Other overlayer/alloy
   combinations, their stability, and reactivity are briefly discussed with
   respect to manipulation of the surface reactivity towards methane. (C)

@article{mishin01:cu,
	Abstract = {We evaluate the ability of the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials and the tight-binding (TB) method to predict reliably energies and stability of nonequilibrium structures by taking Cu as a model material. Two EAM potentials are used here. One is constructed in this work by using more fitting parameters than usual and including {\em ab initio} energies in the fitting database. The other potential was constructed previously using a traditional scheme. Excellent agreement is observed between {\em ab initio}, TB, and EAM results for the energies and stability of several nonequilibrium structures of Cu, as well as for energies along deformation paths between different structures. We conclude that not only TB calculations but also EAM potentials can be suitable for simulations in which correct energies and stability of different atomic configurations are essential, at least for Cu. The bcc, simple cubic, and diamond structures of Cu were identified as elastically unstable, while some other structures (e.g., hcp and 9R) are metastable. As an application of this analysis, nonequilibrium structures of epitaxial Cu films on (001)-oriented fcc or bcc substrates are evaluated using a simple model and atomistic simulations with an EAM potential. In agreement with experimental data, the structure of the film can be either deformed fcc or deformed hcp. The bcc structure cannot be stabilized by epitaxial constraints.},

The potential accurately reproduces the basic lattice properties of B2-NiAl, planar faults, and point-defect characteristics. It also reproduces the energetics and stability of all other structures included in the fit. The potential is applied to calculate equilibrium point-defect concentrations in B2-NiAl as functions of temperature and composition near the stoichiometry. In contrast to previous calculations, the defect formation entropies arising from atomic vibrations are included in our calculation within the quasiharmonic approximation. Such entropies tend to increase the concentrations of thermal point defects in B2-NiAl at high temperatures, but the atomic disorder mechanism remains triple-defect type up to the melting point.},

@article{mishin05:phase_fe_ni,
	Abstract = {First-principles calculations of the energy of various crystal structures of Fe, Ni and ordered Fe\x{2013}Ni compounds with different stoichiometries have been performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method in the generalized gradient approximation. The most stable compounds are L12\x{2013}Ni3Fe, L10\x{2013}FeNi, C11f\x{2013}Ni2Fe and C11f\x{2013}Fe2Ni. The L12\x{2013}Ni3Fe compound has the largest negative formation energy, which is consistent with the experimental Fe\x{2013}Ni phase diagram. The L10\x{2013}FeNi compound has also been observed experimentally in meteorite samples as a metastable phase. It is suggested here that the C11f compounds could also form in Fe\x{2013}Ni alloys at low temperatures. A new semi-empirical interatomic potential has been developed for the Fe\x{2013}Ni system by fitting to experimental data and the results of the LAPW calculations. Recognizing the significance of the covalent component of bonding in this system, the potential is based on the embedded-atom method (EAM) but additionally includes a bond-angle dependence. In comparison with the existing modified EAM method, our potential form is simpler, extends interactions to several (3\x{2013}5) coordination shells and replaces the screening procedure by a smooth cutoff of the potential functions. The potential reproduces a variety of properties of Fe and Ni with a reasonable accuracy. It also reproduces all stability trends across the Fe\x{2013}Ni system established by the LAPW calculations. The potential can be useful in atomistic simulations of the phases of the Fe\x{2013}Ni system.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate an approach to the development of many-body interatomic potentials for monoatomic metals with improved accuracy and reliability. The functional form of the potentials is that of the embedded-atom method, but the interesting features are as follows: (1) The database used for the development of a potential includes both experimental data and a large set of energies of different alternative crystalline structures of the material generated by {\em ab initio} calculations. We introduce a rescaling of interatomic distances in an attempt to improve the compatibility between experimental and {\em ab initio} data. (2) The optimum parametrization of the potential for the given database is obtained by alternating the fitting and testing steps. The testing step includes a comparison between the {\em ab initio} structural energies and those predicted by the potential. This strategy allows us to achieve the best accuracy of fitting within the intrinsic limitations of the potential model. Using this approach we develop reliable interatomic potentials for Al and Ni. The potentials accurately reproduce basic equilibrium properties of these metals, the elastic constants, the phonon-dispersion curves, the vacancy formation and migration energies, the stacking fault energies, and the surface energies. They also predict the right relative stability of different alternative structures with coordination numbers ranging from 12 to 4. The potentials are expected to be easily transferable to different local environments encountered in atomistic simulations of lattice defects.  },

@article{Shibata:2002hh,
	Abstract = {We report on systematic studies of size-dependent alloy formation of silver-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution at ambient temperature using X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS). Various Au-core sizes (2.5-20 nm diameter) and Ag shell thicknesses were synthesized using radiolytic wet techniques. The equilibrium structures (alloy versus core-shell) of these NPs were determined in the suspensions. We observed remarkable size dependence in the room temperature interdiffusion of the two metals. The interdiffusion is limited to the subinterface layers of the bimetallic NPs and depends on both the core size and the total particle size. For the very small particles (less than or equal to4.6 nm initial Au-core size), the two metals are nearly randomly distributed within the particle. However, even for these small Au-core NPs, the interdiffusion occurs primarily in the vicinity of the original interface. Features from the Ag shells do remain. For the larger particles, the boundary is maintained to within one monolayer. These results cannot be explained either by enhanced self-diffusion that results from depression of the melting point with size or by surface melting of the NPs. We propose that defects, such as vacancies, at the bimetallic interface enhance the radial migration (as well as displacement around the interface) of one metal into the other. Molecular dynamics calculations correctly predict the activation energy for diffusion of the metals in the absence of vacancies and show an enormous dependence of the rate of mixing on defect levels. They also suggest that a few percent of the interfacial lattice sites need to be vacant to explain the observed mixing.},

	Abstract = {Bimetallic nanoclusters are of interest because of their utility in catalysis and sensors, The thermal characteristics of bimetallic Pt-Pd nanoclusters of different sizes and compositions were investigated through molecular dynamics simulations using quantum Sutton-Chen (QSC) many-body potentials, Monte Carlo simulations employing the bond order simulation model were used to generate minimum energy configurations, which were utilized as the starting point for molecular dynamics simulations. The calculated initial configurations of the Pt-Pd system consisted of surface segregated Pd atoms and a Pt-rich core, Melting characteristics were studied by following the changes in potential energy and heat capacity as functions of temperature, Structural changes accompanying the thermal evolution were studied by the bond order parameter method. The Pt-Pd clusters exhibited a two-stage melting: surface melting of the external Pd atoms followed by homogeneous melting of the Pt core. These transitions were found to depend on the composition and size of the nanocluster. Melting temperatures of the nanoclusters were found to be much lower than those of bulk Pt and Pd. Bulk melting temperatures of Pd and Pt simulated using periodic boundary conditions compare well with experimental values, thus providing justification for the use of QSC potentials in these simulations. Deformation parameters were calculated to characterize the structural evolution resulting from diffusion of Pd and Pt atoms, The results indicate that in Pd-Pt clusters, Pd atoms prefer to remain at the surface even after melting. In addition, Pt also tends to diffuse to the surface after melting due to reduction of its surface energy with temperature. This mixing pattern is different from those reported in some of the earlier Studies on melting of bimetallics.},

The structures, cohesive energies, and lattice contractions of spherical Ag nanoclusters in the size range 0.5-5.5 nm are analyzed using two different theoretical approaches: an ab initio density functional pseudopotential technique combined with the generalized gradient approximation and the embedded atom method. The surface energies and stresses obtained via the embedded atom method are found to be in good agreement with those predicted by the gradient-corrected ab initio density functional formalism. We estimate the surface energy of Ag nanoclusters to be in the range of 1.0-2.2 J/m(2). Our values are close to the bulk surface energy of silver, but are significantly lower than the recently reported value of 7.2 J/m(2) for free Ag nanoparticles derived from the Kelvin equation.},

The cubo-octahedral Pt-Mo nanoparticles are constructed with disordered fcc configurations, with sizes from 2.5 to 5.0 nm, and with Pt concentrations from 60 to 90 atom \%. The equilibrium Pt-Mo nanoparticle configurations were generated through Monte Carlo simulations allowing both atomic displacements and element exchanges at 600 K. We predict that the Pt atoms weakly segregate to the surfaces of such nanoparticles. The Pt concentrations in the surface are calculated to be 5-14 atom \% higher than the Pt concentrations of the nanoparticles. Moreover, the Pt atoms preferentially segregate to the facet sites of the surface, while the Pt and Mo atoms tend to alternate along the edges and vertexes of these nanoparticles. We found that decreasing the size or increasing the Pt concentration leads to higher Pt concentrations but fewer Pt-Mo pairs in the Pt-Mo nanoparticle surfaces.},

Regions of core or bulk-like atoms and surface atoms can be defined from analyses of structures, atomic coordination, and the local density function of atoms as defined in the SC potential. The core atoms in the nanoparticle behave as bulk-like metal atoms with a predominant face centered cubic (fcc) packing. The interface between surface atoms and core atoms is marked by a peak in the local density function and corresponds to near surface atoms. The near surface atoms and surface atoms prefer a hexagonal closed packing (hcp). The temperature and size effects on structures of the nanoparticle and the dynamics of the surface region and the core region are discussed.},

@article{Timonova:2011ve,
	Abstract = {By applying simulated annealing techniques we fit the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potential to a database of ab initio energies for silicon and construct an improved parametrization of this potential. In addition, we introduce a new, reference-free version of the MEAM potential. This MEAM version is also fitted to the silicon data and shows an even better agreement, although the improvement is modest. Finally, we investigate whether increasing the number of different angular terms in the MEAM potential from 3 to 4 will lead to a better potential. The aim of this work is to determine a broad-ranged potential, one that is reliable in many different low-and high-energy atomic geometries in silicon crystals, molecules, near defects and under strain. To verify this, the performance of the new potentials is tested in different circumstances that were not explicitly included in the fit: relaxed defect energies, thermal expansion, melting temperature and liquid silicon. The new MEAM parametrizations found in this work, called MEAM-M and RF-MEAM, are shown to be overall more accurate than previous potentials-although a few defect energies are exceptions-and we recommend them for future work. The melting temperatures are closer to the experiment than those of other MEAM potentials, but they are still too high.},

	Abstract = {The modified embedded atom method (MEAM) is an empirical extension of embedded atom method (EAM) that includes angular forces. The MEAM, which has previously been applied to the atoms in the FCC, BCC, and diamond cubic crystal systems, has been extended to the HCP crystal structure. Parameters have been determined for HCP metals that have c/a ratios less than ideal. The model is fitted to the lattice constants, elastic constants, cohesive energy, vacancy formation energy, and the BCC-HCP structural energy difference of these metals and is able to reproduce this extensive data base quite well. Structural energies and lattice constants of the HCP metals in a number of cubic structures are predicted. The divacancy is found to be unbound in all of the metals considered except for Be. Stacking fault and surface energies are found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment.},

The rule of the metal is examined by considering calculations ibr metal clusters and the jellium model, both in vacuo and in contact with model solutions. Integral equation approaches to the solution side of the interfaces are reviewed and compared with Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations of analogous molecular models. Computer simulations of metal-water interfaces (including Car-Parinello simulations) and of ionic solution metal interfaces are considered. Finally, a field-theoretical approach to the double-layer and the treatment of rough electrodes are briefly reviewed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {An effective and computationally economical scheme, which unifies density functional description of a metal electronic structure and the classical molecular dynamics description of an electrolyte in contact with the metal, is described. The density functional part of the scheme comprises Car-Parinello and related formalisms. This scheme allows the extension to longer time scale of the simulation of metal-electrolyte interface while keeping fairly good accuracy in the prediction of the metal electronic structure. The numerical scheme is implemented in the relatively simple model of a metal cluster surrounded by an electrolyte. The elementary event of an atom leaving a metal surface as an ion stabilized by solvent molecules has been studied. In particular the potential of mean force of the ion as it dissolves was evaluated. The evolution of the solvation shell of the ion as it leaves the surface is calculated as a further example. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(00)01-066-1. All rights reserved.},

This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity of the electron-ion ensemble and allows us to perform simulations over more than 30 ps. The computer-generated ensemble describes the structural, dynamic, and electronic properties of liquid and amorphous Ge in very good agreement with experiment. The simulation allows us to study in detail the changes in the structure-property relationship through the metal-semiconductor transition. We report a detailed analysis of the local structural properties and their changes induced by an annealing process. The geometrical, bonding, and spectral properties of defects in the disordered tetrahedral network are investigated and compared with experiment.},

	Abstract = {Stepped single-crystal surfaces are viewed as models of real catalysts, which consist of small metal particles exposing a large number of low-coordination sites. We found that stepped platinum (Pt) surfaces can undergo extensive and reversible restructuring when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) at pressures above 0.1 torr. Scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy studies under gaseous environments near ambient pressure at room temperature revealed that as the CO surface coverage approaches 100%, the originally flat terraces of (557) and (332) oriented Pt crystals break up into nanometer-sized clusters and revert to the initial morphology after pumping out the CO gas. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observations whereby the creation of increased concentrations of low-coordination Pt edge sites in the formed nanoclusters relieves the strong CO-CO repulsion in the highly compressed adsorbate film. This restructuring phenomenon has important implications for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.},

	Abstract = {We have studied the trends in CO adsorption on close-packed metal surfaces: Co, Ni, Cu from the 3d row, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag from the 4d row and Ir, Pt, Au from the 5d row using density functional theory. In particular, we were concerned with the trends in adsorption energy, geometry, vibrational properties and other parameters derived from the electronic structure of the substrate. The influence of specific changes in our set-up, such as choice of the exchange correlation functional, the choice of pseudopotential, size of the basis set and substrate relaxation, has been carefully evaluated. We found that, while the geometrical and vibrational properties of the adsorbate--substrate complex are calculated with high accuracy, the adsorption energies calculated with the gradient-corrected Perdew--Wang exchange--correlation energies are overestimated. In addition, the calculations tend to favour adsorption sites with higher coordination, resulting in the prediction of the wrong adsorption sites for the Rh, Pt and Cu surfaces (hollow instead of top). The revised Perdew--Burke--Erzernhof functional (RPBE) leads to lower (i.e. more realistic) adsorption energies for transition metals, but to the wrong results for noble metals---for Ag and Au, endothermic adsorption is predicted. The site preference remains the same. We discuss trends in relation to the electronic structure of the substrate across the periodic table, summarizing the state-of-the-art of CO adsorption on close-packed metal surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Single crystal adsorption calorimetry was applied to investigate the heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen and the reaction heats for the CO oxidation process on Pt􏰊111􏰋 at room temperature. Both sticking probabilities and heats of adsorption for CO and oxygen are presented as a function of coverage. These results are used to interpret the subsequent measurements taken for the CO oxidation process on the same surface. The initial heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 are 180􏰛8 and 339􏰛32 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition the pairwise lateral repulsive interaction between CO molecules in a 􏰔􏰜3􏰙􏰜3􏰈R30$\,^{\circ}$ ordered layer at 􏰒􏰚1/3 is found to be 4 kJ/mol. A detailed Monte Carlo modeling of the dissociative adsorption and sticking probability of oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 is performed. The initial rapid fall in heat is attributed to adsorption on defect sites, and subsequent adsorption on the planar 􏰊111􏰋 surface proceeds with a third neighbor interaction energy between the oxygen adatoms 􏰓3􏰌22 kJ/mol. When gaseous CO reacts with preadsorbed oxygen adatoms, the CO2 produced has an excess energy of 16􏰛8 kJ/mol. {\copyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics. 􏰎S0021-9606􏰔97􏰈02601-9􏰉},

	Abstract = {The desorption of CO from clean Pt(lll) and (loo), and from the same surfaces with par- tial overlayers of sulfur, was studied by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy. The method of desorption rate isotherms was employed for data analysis. The desorption of CO from the (Ill) surface and both surfaces with ordered sulfur overlayers can be described as a first order process with coverage dependent activation energies. The desorption of CO from the clean Pt(100) surface is complicated by the dynamic interaction of the molecule with a thermally activated change of platinum surface structure. On both platinum faces surface sulfur decreases the initial binding energy of CO. As the CO concentration increases, its binding energy decreases very rapidly. This is due to a repulsive interaction which exists between co-adsorbed species.},

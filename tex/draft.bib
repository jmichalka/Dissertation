	Abstract = {ReaxFF force field parameters describing Pt-Pt and Pt-O interactions have been developed and tested. The Pt-Pt parameters are shown to accurately account for the chemical nature{,} atomic structures and other materials properties of bulk platinum phases{,} low and high-index platinum surfaces and nanoclusters. The Pt-O parameters reliably describe bulk platinum oxides{,} as well as oxygen adsorption and oxide formation on Pt(111) terraces and the {111} and {100} steps connecting them. Good agreement between the force field and both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental observations is demonstrated in the relative surface free energies of high symmetry Pt-O surface phases as a function of the oxygen chemical potential{,} making ReaxFF an ideal tool for more detailed investigations of more complex Pt-O surface structures. Validation for its application to studies of the kinetics and dynamics of surface oxide formation in the context of either molecular dynamics (MD) or Monte Carlo simulations are provided in part by a two-part investigation of oxygen diffusion on Pt(111){,} in which nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations and MD simulations are used to characterize diffusion processes and to determine the relevant diffusion coefficients and barriers. Finally{,} the power of the ReaxFF reactive force field approach in addressing surface structures well beyond the reach of routine DFT calculations is exhibited in a brief proof-of-concept study of oxygen adsorbate displacement within ordered overlayers.},

@article{Eren:2016qt,
	Abstract = {The most closely packed surfaces of transition metals are usually stable under vacuum, but during catalytic reactions, energetic changes that result from adsorbing molecules could change the surface structure. Eren et al. present an extreme example for carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on the (111) surface of copper at very low partial pressures. The surface decomposed into small nanoclusters (most containing 3 or 19 atoms). The surface was more reactive than the original and, for example, could dissociate adsorbed water at room temperature.Science, this issue p. 475The (111) surface of copper (Cu), its most compact and lowest energy surface, became unstable when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) gas. Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that at room temperature in the pressure range 0.1 to 100 Torr, the surface decomposed into clusters decorated by CO molecules attached to edge atoms. Between 0.2 and a few Torr CO, the clusters became mobile in the scale of minutes. Density functional theory showed that the energy gain from CO binding to low-coordinated Cu atoms and the weakening of binding of Cu to neighboring atoms help drive this process. Particularly for softer metals, the optimal balance of these two effects occurs near reaction conditions. Cluster formation activated the surface for water dissociation, an important step in the water-gas shift reaction.},

	Abstract = {Applying a synthesis procedure that promotes alloy formation, highly-dispersed alumina-supported Pt--Pd catalysts spanning the Pt-rich half of the composition range were prepared, aged under oxygen-rich hydrothermal conditions, and characterized by CO chemisorption, XRD, and TEM. Anomalously large particles, typical of pure Pt catalysts treated under such conditions, were not found in any of the Pd-containing catalysts, and the extent of particle coarsening due to aging was found to decrease with increasing Pd content. Alloying appears to have little effect on the NO oxidation turn-over frequency, which increases with decreasing dispersion.},

	Abstract = {The exploration of heterogeneous catalysts using first-principles calculations can be daunting because the large number of atoms and possible surface geometries. Calle-Vallejo et al. describe a simpler metric for assessing optimal reactivity: a weighted average of surface coordination that includes second-nearest neighbors (see the Perspective by Stephens et al.). The calculations identified three approaches for introducing cavity sites into the platinum(111) surface to improve its performance for the oxygen reduction reaction used in fuel cells.Science, this issue p. 185, see also p. 164A good heterogeneous catalyst for a given chemical reaction very often has only one specific type of surface site that is catalytically active. Widespread methodologies such as Sabatier-type activity plots determine optimal adsorption energies to maximize catalytic activity, but these are difficult to use as guidelines to devise new catalysts. We introduce {\textquotedblleft}coordination-activity plots{\textquotedblright} that predict the geometric structure of optimal active sites. The method is illustrated on the oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed by platinum. Sites with the same number of first-nearest neighbors as (111) terraces but with an increased number of second-nearest neighbors are predicted to have superior catalytic activity. We used this rationale to create highly active sites on platinum (111), without alloying and using three different affordable experimental methods.},

	Abstract = {Combined IR reflection-absorption and LEED studies of the room temperature adsorption of carbon monoxide on the (100), (111) and (210) surfaces of palladium are reported. The CO stretch frequency on the (100) surface varies from 1895 cm−1 at low coverages to 1949 cm−1 at θ= 0.5. A further strong shift to higher frequency is observed during the compression stage for θ{$>$} 0.5. On the (111) surface the CO stretch frequency is found at 1823 cm−1 at very low coverages, rising to 1936 cm−1 at θ= 0.5. In the compression stage above θ= 0.5 a second peak is observed above 2000 cm−1. On the much more open (210) surface, where surface atoms with the next nearest neighbour distance of 2.73 {\AA}do not exist, the behaviour of the IR band resembles surprisingly that of the (100) surface. The infrared reflection studies provide detailed information on the CO/Pd system which other surface techniques have not as yet revealed, namely, evidence for surface specificity and localised site adsorption at low CO coverage. The frequency shifts observed in the spectra are discussed in terms of the three important intermolecular interaction mechanisms, namely, dipole-dipole coupling, direct intermolecular repulsion and indirect effects via the metal atoms.},

@article{Conrad:1978fx,
	Abstract = {Adsorption, mutual interactions and transient product formation between oxygen and carbon monoxide on a Pd(111) surface were studied by means of LEED, UPS and isothermal as well as temperature-programmed desorption spectrometry at temperatures between 200 and 550 K. CO adsorption at 200 K was found to cause the formation of additional periodic overlayer structures above θ= 0.5, apart from the already known surface structures at θ{$<$} 0.5. Saturation is reached with a hexagonal close-packed layer at θ= 0.66 (≜1 ×1015moleculescm2). Depending on the sequence of gas exposure and on the partial coverages of COad andOad, different stages of coadsorption (island formation, ``compression''of the 2 ×2-Oad layer into a √3 ×√3 R 30$\,^{\circ}$structure, growth of a mixed phase with 2 ×1 periodicity etc.) may be distinguished, which influence the electronic properties and the reactivity of the adsorbates. At high surface concentrations CO2 formation proceeds with an appreciable rate already at 200 K, whereas at low coverages temperatures above 400 K are needed. The results demonstrate that no appropriate description of the kinetics of catalytic CO2 formation over the whole range of surface concentrations may be achieved in terms of simple rate laws involving coverage-independent rate constants (and activation energies) and mere surface concentrations of the reactants. There is on the other hand no indication for a reaction path involving the collision of a gaseous CO molecule with an adsorbed oxygen atom (Eley-Rideal mechanism), i.e. the reaction proceeds always with chemisorbed CO via Oad + COad →CO2 (Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism).},

The desorption of CO from the (Ill) surface and both surfaces with ordered sulfur overlayers can be described as a first order process with coverage dependent activation energies. The desorption of CO from the clean Pt(100) surface is complicated by the dynamic interaction of the molecule with a thermally activated change of platinum surface structure. On both platinum faces surface sulfur decreases the initial binding energy of CO. As the CO concentration increases, its binding energy decreases very rapidly. This is due to a repulsive interaction which exists between co-adsorbed species.},

The clean Pd(111) structure is confirmed to be close to the ideal0 bulk structure. Slight, possibly hydrogen-induced deviations are obtained for the interlayer spacings down to the fifth layer: Δd12=+0.03$\pm$0.03 {\AA}, Δd23=−0.03$\pm$0.03{\AA}, and Δd34=Δd45=+0.05$\pm$0.03{\AA}(positive values indicate expansion from the bulk spacing value). The CO molecules are favored to adsorb at fcc-type hollow sites with the C-O axis perpendicular to the 0 surface. The optimal carbon-oxygen and metal-carbon bond lengths are 1.15$\pm$0.05 and 2.05$\pm$0.04 {\AA}, respectively. This is the first LEED structure analysis of CO adsorbed at a hollow site on clean metal surfaces without coadsorbates.},

By itself, sulfur chemisorbs, forming a p(2 x 2) ordered structure, and induces doubling of the terrace widths and step heights. Subsequent coadsorption of CO displaces the sulfur, compressing it to distances of root 3 times the Pt lattice spacing, and induces surface restructuring; New terraces form which contain exclusively CO and are separated by monatomic steps from the terraces containing the compressed sulfur overlayer. This coadsorbate induced restructuring phenomenon has strong implications in the mechanisms of surface catalyzed reactions.},

	Abstract = {Single crystal adsorption calorimetry was applied to investigate the heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen and the reaction heats for the CO oxidation process on Pt􏰊111􏰋 at room temperature. Both sticking probabilities and heats of adsorption for CO and oxygen are presented as a function of coverage. These results are used to interpret the subsequent measurements taken for the CO oxidation process on the same surface. The initial heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 are 180􏰛8 and 339􏰛32 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition the pairwise lateral repulsive interaction between CO molecules in a 􏰔􏰜3􏰙􏰜3􏰈R30$\,^{\circ}$ ordered layer at 􏰒􏰚1/3 is found to be 4 kJ/mol. A detailed Monte Carlo modeling of the dissociative adsorption and sticking probability of oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 is performed. The initial rapid fall in heat is attributed to adsorption on defect sites, and subsequent adsorption on the planar 􏰊111􏰋 surface proceeds with a third neighbor interaction energy between the oxygen adatoms 􏰓3􏰌22 kJ/mol.

@article{Thostrup:2001dn,
	Abstract = {Through an interplay between density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we show that an intermediate coverage of CO on the Pt(110) surface gives rise to a new rough equilibrium structure with more than 50\% step atoms. CO is shown to bind so strongly to low-coordinated Pt atoms that it can break Pt-Pt bonds and spontaneously form steps on the surface. It is argued that adsorption-induced step formation may be a general effect, in particular at high gas pressures and temperatures.},

	Abstract = {The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the main limitation for automotive applications. We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt3Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure (d-band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O2 adsorption.},

We synthesized Pd-Pt bimetallic nanodendrites consisting of a dense array of Pt branches on a Pd core by reducing K2PtCl4 with L-ascorbic acid in the presence of uniform Pd nanocrystal seeds in an aqueous solution. The Pt branches supported on faceted Pd nanocrystals exhibited relatively large surface areas and particularly active facets toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the rate-determining step in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell. The Pd-Pt nanodendrites were two and a half times more active on the basis of equivalent Pt mass for the ORR than the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and five times more active than the first-generation supportless Pt-black catalyst.},

@article{Bliznakov:2012kx,
	Abstract = {In this article we describe further improvement of high-performance Pt monolayer-shell on carbon-supported Pd nanowires/nanorods-core electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This improvement is facilitated by electrochemical deposition of Pd nanostructured cores on functionalized carbon surfaces. We describe in some detail this first electrochemical deposition of Pd nanowires, including the effect of deposition parameters on the deposits morphology, and propose the mechanism of the Pd nanostructures growth. The one-dimensional growth of Pd is ascribed to the hydrogen-underpotential-deposition-mediated layer-by-layer deposition of Pd. The surface structure of deposited nanowires is composed predominantly of the {111}-oriented facets that facilitate the enhanced oxygen reduction and high stability of these electrocatalysts. They have significantly higher Pt mass-, and area- specific activities and performance stability under potential cycling conditions than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, which indicates their great potential for resolving the remaining obstacles to commercializing PEMFCs.},

Whereas current DFT implementations suffer from problems in predicting the correct adsorption site of CO on Pt{111}, the current MEAM potential quantitatively describes the adsorption energies on the Pt {100} and {111} surfaces. With this potential, one is able to model, amongst others, diffusional properties and the CO induced lifting of the Pt{100}-hex surface reconstruction.},

	Abstract = {First-principles calculations of the energy of various crystal structures of Fe, Ni and ordered Fe\x{2013}Ni compounds with different stoichiometries have been performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method in the generalized gradient approximation. The most stable compounds are L12\x{2013}Ni3Fe, L10\x{2013}FeNi, C11f\x{2013}Ni2Fe and C11f\x{2013}Fe2Ni. The L12\x{2013}Ni3Fe compound has the largest negative formation energy, which is consistent with the experimental Fe\x{2013}Ni phase diagram. The L10\x{2013}FeNi compound has also been observed experimentally in meteorite samples as a metastable phase. It is suggested here that the C11f compounds could also form in Fe\x{2013}Ni alloys at low temperatures. A new semi-empirical interatomic potential has been developed for the Fe\x{2013}Ni system by fitting to experimental data and the results of the LAPW calculations. Recognizing the significance of the covalent component of bonding in this system, the potential is based on the embedded-atom method (EAM) but additionally includes a bond-angle dependence. In comparison with the existing modified EAM method, our potential form is simpler, extends interactions to several (3\x{2013}5) coordination shells and replaces the screening procedure by a smooth cutoff of the potential functions. The potential reproduces a variety of properties of Fe and Ni with a reasonable accuracy. It also reproduces all stability trends across the Fe\x{2013}Ni system established by the LAPW calculations. The potential can be useful in atomistic simulations of the phases of the Fe\x{2013}Ni system.},

	Abstract = {Semiempirical interatomic potentials have been developed for Al, $\alpha$-Ti, and $\gamma$-TiAl within the embedded atom method (EAM) formalism by fitting to a large database of experimental as well as ab initio data. The ab initio calculations were performed by the linearized augmented plane wave (LAPW) method within the density functional theory to obtain the equations of state for a number of crystal structures of the Ti-Al system. Some of the calculated LAPW energies were used for fitting the potentials while others for examining their quality. The potentials correctly predict the equilibrium crystal structures of the phases and accurately reproduce their basic lattice properties. The potentials are applied to calculate the energies of point defects, surfaces, and planar faults in the equilibrium structures. Unlike earlier EAM potentials for the Ti-Al system, the proposed potentials provide a reasonable description of the lattice thermal expansion, demonstrating their usefulness for molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations at high temperatures. The energy along the tetragonal deformation path (Bain transformation) in $\gamma$-TiAl calculated with the EAM potential is in fairly good agreement with LAPW calculations. Equilibrium point defect concentrations in $\gamma$-TiAl are studied using the EAM potential. It is found that antisite defects strongly },

	Abstract = {An embedded-atom potential has been constructed for the intermetallic compound B2-NiAl by fitting to both experimental properties and {\em ab initio} data. The {\em ab initio} data have been generated in the form of energy-volume relations for a number of alternative structures of NiAl and Ni$_3$Al, as well as for Ni and Al. The potential accurately reproduces the basic lattice properties of B2-NiAl, planar faults, and point-defect characteristics. It also reproduces the energetics and stability of all other structures included in the fit. The potential is applied to calculate equilibrium point-defect concentrations in B2-NiAl as functions of temperature and composition near the stoichiometry. In contrast to previous calculations, the defect formation entropies arising from atomic vibrations are included in our calculation within the quasiharmonic approximation. Such entropies tend to increase the concentrations of thermal point defects in B2-NiAl at high temperatures, but the atomic disorder mechanism remains triple-defect type up to the melting point.},

@article{Shibata:2002hh,
	Abstract = {We report on systematic studies of size-dependent alloy formation of silver-coated gold nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution at ambient temperature using X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS). Various Au-core sizes (2.5-20 nm diameter) and Ag shell thicknesses were synthesized using radiolytic wet techniques. The equilibrium structures (alloy versus core-shell) of these NPs were determined in the suspensions. We observed remarkable size dependence in the room temperature interdiffusion of the two metals. The interdiffusion is limited to the subinterface layers of the bimetallic NPs and depends on both the core size and the total particle size. For the very small particles (less than or equal to4.6 nm initial Au-core size), the two metals are nearly randomly distributed within the particle. However, even for these small Au-core NPs, the interdiffusion occurs primarily in the vicinity of the original interface. Features from the Ag shells do remain. For the larger particles, the boundary is maintained to within one monolayer. These results cannot be explained either by enhanced self-diffusion that results from depression of the melting point with size or by surface melting of the NPs. We propose that defects, such as vacancies, at the bimetallic interface enhance the radial migration (as well as displacement around the interface) of one metal into the other. Molecular dynamics calculations correctly predict the activation energy for diffusion of the metals in the absence of vacancies and show an enormous dependence of the rate of mixing on defect levels. They also suggest that a few percent of the interfacial lattice sites need to be vacant to explain the observed mixing.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate the ability of the embedded-atom method (EAM) potentials and the tight-binding (TB) method to predict reliably energies and stability of nonequilibrium structures by taking Cu as a model material. Two EAM potentials are used here. One is constructed in this work by using more fitting parameters than usual and including {\em ab initio} energies in the fitting database. The other potential was constructed previously using a traditional scheme. Excellent agreement is observed between {\em ab initio}, TB, and EAM results for the energies and stability of several nonequilibrium structures of Cu, as well as for energies along deformation paths between different structures. We conclude that not only TB calculations but also EAM potentials can be suitable for simulations in which correct energies and stability of different atomic configurations are essential, at least for Cu. The bcc, simple cubic, and diamond structures of Cu were identified as elastically unstable, while some other structures (e.g., hcp and 9R) are metastable. As an application of this analysis, nonequilibrium structures of epitaxial Cu films on (001)-oriented fcc or bcc substrates are evaluated using a simple model and atomistic simulations with an EAM potential. In agreement with experimental data, the structure of the film can be either deformed fcc or deformed hcp. The bcc structure cannot be stabilized by epitaxial constraints.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate an approach to the development of many-body interatomic potentials for monoatomic metals with improved accuracy and reliability. The functional form of the potentials is that of the embedded-atom method, but the interesting features are as follows: (1) The database used for the development of a potential includes both experimental data and a large set of energies of different alternative crystalline structures of the material generated by {\em ab initio} calculations. We introduce a rescaling of interatomic distances in an attempt to improve the compatibility between experimental and {\em ab initio} data. (2) The optimum parametrization of the potential for the given database is obtained by alternating the fitting and testing steps. The testing step includes a comparison between the {\em ab initio} structural energies and those predicted by the potential. This strategy allows us to achieve the best accuracy of fitting within the intrinsic limitations of the potential model. Using this approach we develop reliable interatomic potentials for Al and Ni. The potentials accurately reproduce basic equilibrium properties of these metals, the elastic constants, the phonon-dispersion curves, the vacancy formation and migration energies, the stacking fault energies, and the surface energies. They also predict the right relative stability of different alternative structures with coordination numbers ranging from 12 to 4. The potentials are expected to be easily transferable to different local environments encountered in atomistic simulations of lattice defects.  },

The structures, cohesive energies, and lattice contractions of spherical Ag nanoclusters in the size range 0.5-5.5 nm are analyzed using two different theoretical approaches: an ab initio density functional pseudopotential technique combined with the generalized gradient approximation and the embedded atom method. The surface energies and stresses obtained via the embedded atom method are found to be in good agreement with those predicted by the gradient-corrected ab initio density functional formalism. We estimate the surface energy of Ag nanoclusters to be in the range of 1.0-2.2 J/m(2). Our values are close to the bulk surface energy of silver, but are significantly lower than the recently reported value of 7.2 J/m(2) for free Ag nanoparticles derived from the Kelvin equation.},

The cubo-octahedral Pt-Mo nanoparticles are constructed with disordered fcc configurations, with sizes from 2.5 to 5.0 nm, and with Pt concentrations from 60 to 90 atom \%. The equilibrium Pt-Mo nanoparticle configurations were generated through Monte Carlo simulations allowing both atomic displacements and element exchanges at 600 K. We predict that the Pt atoms weakly segregate to the surfaces of such nanoparticles. The Pt concentrations in the surface are calculated to be 5-14 atom \% higher than the Pt concentrations of the nanoparticles. Moreover, the Pt atoms preferentially segregate to the facet sites of the surface, while the Pt and Mo atoms tend to alternate along the edges and vertexes of these nanoparticles. We found that decreasing the size or increasing the Pt concentration leads to higher Pt concentrations but fewer Pt-Mo pairs in the Pt-Mo nanoparticle surfaces.},

The core atoms in the nanoparticle behave as bulk-like metal atoms with a predominant face centered cubic (fcc) packing. The interface between surface atoms and core atoms is marked by a peak in the local density function and corresponds to near surface atoms. The near surface atoms and surface atoms prefer a hexagonal closed packing (hcp).

	Abstract = {An effective and computationally economical scheme, which unifies density functional description of a metal electronic structure and the classical molecular dynamics description of an electrolyte in contact with the metal, is described. The density functional part of the scheme comprises Car-Parinello and related formalisms. This scheme allows the extension to longer time scale of the simulation of metal-electrolyte interface while keeping fairly good accuracy in the prediction of the metal electronic structure. The numerical scheme is implemented in the relatively simple model of a metal cluster surrounded by an electrolyte. The elementary event of an atom leaving a metal surface as an ion stabilized by solvent molecules has been studied. In particular the potential of mean force of the ion as it dissolves was evaluated. The evolution of the solvation shell of the ion as it leaves the surface is calculated as a further example. (C) 2000 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(00)01-066-1. All rights reserved.},

This method gives perfect control of the adiabaticity of the electron-ion ensemble and allows us to perform simulations over more than 30 ps. The computer-generated ensemble describes the structural, dynamic, and electronic properties of liquid and amorphous Ge in very good agreement with experiment. The simulation allows us to study in detail the changes in the structure-property relationship through the metal-semiconductor transition. We report a detailed analysis of the local structural properties and their changes induced by an annealing process. The geometrical, bonding, and spectral properties of defects in the disordered tetrahedral network are investigated and compared with experiment.},

@article{Larsen:1999le,
	Abstract = {{One of the prominent arguments for performing surface science studies
   have for many years been to improve and design new and better catalysts.
   Although surface science has provided the fundamental framework and
   tools for understanding heterogeneous catalysis until now there have
   been extremely few examples of actually designing new catalysts based
   solely on surface science studies. In this review, we shall demonstrate
   how a close collaboration between different fundamental disciplines like
   structural-, theoretical-and reactivity-studies of surfaces as well as a
   strong interaction with industry can have strong synergetic effects and
   how this was used to develop a new catalyst. As so often before the
   studies reviewed here were not initiated with the objective to solve a
   specific problem, but realizing that a new class of very stable
   two-dimensional alloys could be synthesized from otherwise immiscible
   metals made it possible to present a new solution to a specific problem
   in the industrial catalysis relating to methane activation in the steam
   reforming process. Methane is the main constituent of natural gas and it
   is an extremely important raw material for many large scale chemical
   processes such as production of hydrogen, ammonia, and methanol. In the
   steam reforming process methane and water are converted into a mixture
   of mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the so-called synthesis gas.
   Industrially the steam reforming process usually takes place over a
   catalyst containing small nickel crystallites highly dispersed on a
   porous support material like aluminum/magnesium oxides in order to
   achieve a high active metal area. There is a general consensus that the
   rate limiting step of this process is the dissociative sticking of
   methane on the nickel surface. Driven by the desire to understand this
   step and hopefully be able to manipulate the reactivity, a large number
   of investigations of the methane/nickel interaction have been performed
   using nickel single crystals as model catalysts. The process has been
   investigated, both under thermal conditions and by using supersonic
   molecular beams elucidating the dynamical aspects of the interaction.
   The results obtained will be reviewed both with respect to the clean and
   modified nickel surfaces. Especially the two-dimensional gold-nickel
   alloy system will be considered since the fundamental results here have
   lead to the invention of a new nickel based catalyst, which is much more
   resistant to carbon formation than the conventional nickel catalysts.
   This may be one of the first examples of how fundamental research can
   lead to the invention of new catalysts. Other overlayer/alloy
   combinations, their stability, and reactivity are briefly discussed with
   respect to manipulation of the surface reactivity towards methane. (C)

	Abstract = {Abstract The nature of the oxygen species adsorbed to silver surfaces is a key component of the heterogeneously catalyzed epoxidation of ethylene and partial oxidation methanol over silver catalysts. We report the formation of two different silver-oxygen species depending on the flux and energy of incident gas-phase oxygen atoms on an Ag(111) surface. A combination of surface science techniques was used to characterize the oxidized surfaces. Atomic oxygen was generated with an Ir filament; lower temperatures created surface oxides previously reported. When O was deposited with a higher a filament temperature, the surface became highly corrugated and little subsurface oxygen was observed, and thin layers of Ag2O were likely formed. These results show that the energy and flux of oxygen are important parameters in the chemical identity and abundance of oxygen on silver surfaces and suggests that formation of the Ag2O thin film hinders formation of subsurface oxygen. },

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysts that contain bimetallic nanoparticles may undergo segregation of the metals, driven by oxidizing and reducing environments. The structure and composition of core-shell Rh0.5Pd0.5 and Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticle catalysts were studied in situ, during oxidizing, reducing, and catalytic reactions involving NO, O2, CO, and H2 by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at near-ambient pressure. The Rh0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticles underwent dramatic and reversible changes in composition and chemical state in response to oxidizing or reducing conditions. In contrast, no substantial segregation of Pd or Pt atoms was found in Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticles. The different behaviors in restructuring and chemical response of Rh0.5Pd0.5 and Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticle catalysts under the same reaction conditions illustrates the flexibility and tunability of the structure of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts during catalytic reactions.},

@article{Tao:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Stepped single-crystal surfaces are viewed as models of real catalysts, which consist of small metal particles exposing a large number of low-coordination sites. We found that stepped platinum (Pt) surfaces can undergo extensive and reversible restructuring when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) at pressures above 0.1 torr. Scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy studies under gaseous environments near ambient pressure at room temperature revealed that as the CO surface coverage approaches 100%, the originally flat terraces of (557) and (332) oriented Pt crystals break up into nanometer-sized clusters and revert to the initial morphology after pumping out the CO gas. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observations whereby the creation of increased concentrations of low-coordination Pt edge sites in the formed nanoclusters relieves the strong CO-CO repulsion in the highly compressed adsorbate film. This restructuring phenomenon has important implications for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.},

This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. There were insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over the course of cycling, in contrast to sizable losses observed with the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential.},

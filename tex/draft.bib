	Abstract = {Abstract The nature of the oxygen species adsorbed to silver surfaces is a key component of the heterogeneously catalyzed epoxidation of ethylene and partial oxidation methanol over silver catalysts. We report the formation of two different silver-oxygen species depending on the flux and energy of incident gas-phase oxygen atoms on an Ag(111) surface. A combination of surface science techniques was used to characterize the oxidized surfaces. Atomic oxygen was generated with an Ir filament; lower temperatures created surface oxides previously reported. When O was deposited with a higher a filament temperature, the surface became highly corrugated and little subsurface oxygen was observed, and thin layers of Ag2O were likely formed. These results show that the energy and flux of oxygen are important parameters in the chemical identity and abundance of oxygen on silver surfaces and suggests that formation of the Ag2O thin film hinders formation of subsurface oxygen. },

	Abstract = {Heterogeneous catalysts that contain bimetallic nanoparticles may undergo segregation of the metals, driven by oxidizing and reducing environments. The structure and composition of core-shell Rh0.5Pd0.5 and Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticle catalysts were studied in situ, during oxidizing, reducing, and catalytic reactions involving NO, O2, CO, and H2 by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy at near-ambient pressure. The Rh0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticles underwent dramatic and reversible changes in composition and chemical state in response to oxidizing or reducing conditions. In contrast, no substantial segregation of Pd or Pt atoms was found in Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticles. The different behaviors in restructuring and chemical response of Rh0.5Pd0.5 and Pt0.5Pd0.5 nanoparticle catalysts under the same reaction conditions illustrates the flexibility and tunability of the structure of bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts during catalytic reactions.},

@article{Tao:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Stepped single-crystal surfaces are viewed as models of real catalysts, which consist of small metal particles exposing a large number of low-coordination sites. We found that stepped platinum (Pt) surfaces can undergo extensive and reversible restructuring when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) at pressures above 0.1 torr. Scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy studies under gaseous environments near ambient pressure at room temperature revealed that as the CO surface coverage approaches 100%, the originally flat terraces of (557) and (332) oriented Pt crystals break up into nanometer-sized clusters and revert to the initial morphology after pumping out the CO gas. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observations whereby the creation of increased concentrations of low-coordination Pt edge sites in the formed nanoclusters relieves the strong CO-CO repulsion in the highly compressed adsorbate film. This restructuring phenomenon has important implications for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.},

This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. There were insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over the course of cycling, in contrast to sizable losses observed with the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential.},

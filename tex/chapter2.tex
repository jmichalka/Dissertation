\chapter{METHODOLOGIES}
%CHAP2

\section{Metal Interactions}
% Talk about challenges of metal interactions as compared to simple pair-wise interactions
% energy dependent on local environment
% Introduce EAM, many equations, one to two figures?, justify choice
% Good at mixing, Pt/Pd bimetallic etc.

\section{Metal-Adsorbate Interactions}
% Covalent, non covalent (strength of interaction)
% focus on M-CO, describe M-C, M-O, why repulsive morse
% image of different pieces of the potential from midwest
% 

\section{Adsorbate-Adsorbate}
% Brief mention of Karplus and Straub
% Focus on quadrupolar repulsion, graph that shows electrostatic repulsion at 2.77 \AA



\section{Electrostatics}
% Brief mention of Damped Shifted Force
% If we modify the electrostatics in the metal to deal with the polarization catastrophe


\subsection{Multiple Minima Fluctuating Charges (MM-FlucQ)}
% portions of the white paper
% how much will be in a paper vs in here...

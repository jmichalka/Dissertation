In the introduction add a section on molecular dynamics
rough outline:
  Modeling Metals
    Interactions
      Metal-Metal (EAM), take out EAM in chapter 2 (and more)
      Metal-Adsorbate, LJ, Morse
      Electrostatics
	Drude
	Fluctuating
    Integrator/Dynamics

Chapter 4
  Include new data for 112

  Hopping dynamics/energetics

Chapter 5
  Introduce polarizability in general
    Drude, charge transfer, gaussians (Siepmann and Klein?)

  Check, completing the square

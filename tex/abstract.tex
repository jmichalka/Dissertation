\title{ADSORBATE INDUCED RECONSTRUCTIONS ON METAL SURFACES}
\author{Joseph R. Michalka}
In this dissertation I present work on the modeling of adsorbate-metal
interactions with a specific focus on Carbon Monoxide (CO) induced
restructuring of Platinum stepped surfaces. Additionally, I will present work
on the development of a multiple-minima fluctuating charge (MM-flucQ) potential
which has been used to simulate charge transfer and oxide formation on Platinum
surfaces.

New Pt-CO and Au-CO forcefields were developed to study coverage-dependent
restructuring of high-index Platinum \& Gold (557) surfaces. It was observed
that the weak Au-CO binding led to minimal disruption of the surface, whereas
the strong Pt-CO interactions resulted in significant disruption of the
step-edges which led to increased step-wandering. Specifically, the strong
CO-CO quadrupolar repulsion caused an increase in adatom mobility. This
increased mobility eventually led to large-scale surface reconstructions.

A Platinum/Palladium (557) surface was simulated to explore the interplay
between CO-induced reconstruction on a more complicated bimetallic surface. The
Pt-CO forcefield was retuned while a new Pd-CO forcefield was developed.  The
difference in binding strengths was found to play an important role in the
disruption of the Pt/Pd surface while the preferred binding sites on each
system (Pt: atop, Pd: bridge/hollow) led to different behaviors with regards to
surface diffusion and mobility.

The importance of step-edges energetics for the formation of adatoms as
observed from earlier work encouraged us to directly examine the differences
between straight edged (557) \& (112) and kinked edged (765) \& (321) Pt
surfaces.  As hypothesized, the systems with rougher edges experienced a
greater amount of surface diffusion and a concomitantly increased amount of
step-wandering. The length of the (111) plateaus between step edges also played
an important role with regard to the extent of surface reconstruction observed.

Accurate treatment of the electrostatic interactions between adsorbates and
surfaces is often neglected in molecular dynamics simulations because of the
increased computational cost and difficulty of implementation.  Our new MM-flucq
potential allows us to more properly describe a metal surface's response to
impinging charged species in a dynamic fashion by allowing the charges on each
atomic site to fluctuate in response to the local electronic environment.

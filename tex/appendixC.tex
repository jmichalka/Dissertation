\section{Introduction}


%intro line about catalysts
Catalysts are at the center of numerous industrial and scientific processes,
however the majority of effective catalysts are composed of expensive metals
such as \ce{Pt}, \ce{Pd}, \ce{Rh}, \ce{Au}, and \ce{Ag}.  In order to address
this issue of costly catalytic materials there has been an impetus to design
and characterize new bimetallic materials,\citep{Yu:2012by, Han:2015qr}
near-surface alloys (NSA),\citep{Jan-Knudsen:2007fe, Stephens:2011bv} and
dispersed nanostructures\citep{Shibata:2002hh,Kugai:2011rt} from cheaper
materials.  These catalysts have the potential to be finely-tuned for specific
reactions while reducing the needed amount of the expensive metal by replacing
it with a cheaper one. As an example \ce{Pt3Ni} catalysts have been created
that show an increased activity for the oxygen reduction reaction while
replacing a portion of \ce{Pt} with the much cheaper
\ce{Ni}.\citep{Stamenkovic:2007kk,Tuaev:2013fk} The stability of these types of
materials is called into question however as Tao {\em et al.} show in their
study of \ce{Pd/Rh} core-shell nanoparticles which experienced large-scale
inversions of material depending on the oxidizing or reducing nature of the
environment.\citep{Tao:2008aa} That is, under an oxidizing atmosphere, \ce{Rh}
made up the outer shell of the nanoparticle while under a reducing atmosphere,
\ce{Pd} migrated to the surface instead. This appendix provides information on
the initial creation of bimetallic Pt/Pd near-surface alloys and the
preliminary results obtained before the project was shelved.

\section{Methodology}
The (111) systems were initially thermalized at 200~K and warmed up in the
canonical (NVT) ensemble  to 1000~K over 500 ps. They were then allowed to
reach equilibrium at 1000~K over another 500 ps at which point they were dosed
with a sufficient quantity of Carbon Monoxide (\ce{CO}) to correspond to either
0, 0.25, or 0.5 monolayers (ML) of coverage. The systems were further
equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 500 ps before switching to the
microcanonical (NVE) ensemble for 6 ns of data collection. The (100) systems
were treated identically except that they were warmed and equilibrated at 600~K
and kept at that temperature throughout the simulation.

\subsection{Interaction Potentials}
The interaction potentials provided in Michalka {\em et
al.}\citep{Michalka:2015aa} are used here unchanged. Important to note is that
the \ce{Pd\bond{-}CO} interaction is slightly stronger than the
\ce{Pt\bond{-}CO} interaction for this parameterization.

\subsection{System details}
The systems were constructed from a FCC \ce{Pt} crystal that was ``sliced'' to
display either a (111) or (100) facet in the {\em z}-direction while being
periodic in the {\em x} and {\em y} directions. The bulk of the crystal was
kept as \ce{Pt} while one or two layers directly underneath the surface were
converted to \ce{Pd}. The ideal systems are highlighted in the top row of
Figure \ref{fig:biSystems}. The (111) systems have dimensions of
$71.41\times82.44\times100$ \AA\textsuperscript{3}, while the (100) systems are
$68.78\times68.78\times100$ \AA\textsuperscript{3}. \ce{Pd} was chosen as the
subsurface layer because of its stronger binding to \ce{CO}. During preliminary
simulations, a variety of possible systems that switched the order of the
metals or the number of layers at the surface or beneath the surface led to no
reconstruction because of a lack of any driving force.  However, when \ce{Pt}
is on the surface, there are two effects that lead to restructuring, \ce{Pt}'s
higher surface energy, {\em i.e.} desire to be in a bulk environment, and the
greater strength of the \ce{Pd\bond{-}CO} compared to the \ce{Pt\bond{-}CO}
interaction.

\section{Results \& Discussion}
The (100) surfaces were inherently unstable at any CO-coverage and the surface
\ce{Pt} collapsed to domains of (111) which exposed the underlying (100)
\ce{Pd} which did remain fairly stable. As shown in Figure
\ref{fig:biSystems}.c and \ref{fig:biSystems}.d the initially (100) surface
restructures to the lower energy (111) domains. This is shown a bit more cleary
in Figure \ref{fig:surfaceGrid} although a small portion of the surface did
retain the original (100) motif. Additionally, because of the way adsorbate
coverage was initially calculated, this restructuring creates more surface
sites for the \ce{CO} to bind too which can be seen by comparing the (111) to
the (100) systems in Figure \ref{fig:biSystems} and seeing the large amount of
\ce{CO} that is not adsorbed in the (111) systems.

\subsection{Inversion}
One mechanism for surface restructuring is that of atom inversion, where an
atom from a subsurface layer exchanges positions with an atom on the surface.
This process strongly depends on the stability of the surface and the strength
of metal-metal interactions as many of those bonds will need to be broken or
weakened for this process to occur.  The \ce{Pt/Pd} systems modeled in this
study showed some evidence of this process over the short amount of simulation
time, specifically on the higher \ce{CO} coverage systems. As highlighted in
Figure \ref{fig:inversion}, over a period of 5 ns (left image 1 ns, right image
6 ns) an additional 6 \ce{Pt} atoms were replaced with the subsurface \ce{Pd}.
This process is energetically favorable because the \ce{Pt\bond{-}Pt} andd
\ce{Pt\bond{-}Pd} bonds are stronger than the \ce{Pd\bond{-}Pd} interactions.
However, the kinetic barrier for this process is large since it requires some
amount of lifting or compressing of the surface atom as well as a small vacancy
formation at some point in the subsurface. Henkelman {\em et al.} modeling
(111) and (100) \ce{Au/Pd} surfaces observed that the presence of a vacany on
the surface drastically increased the rates of surface
segregation.\citep{Kim:2013mi} The presence of \ce{CO} appears to slightly
lower the barrier as the systems with \ce{CO} were observed to have a greater
number of \ce{Pd} on the surface at the end of our simulations. If the systems
had been run for significantly longer, it is likely that small domains or
patches of \ce{Pd} would have formed on the surface, as those sites with their
weaker cross-interactions would be more energetically favorable for additional
inversion events. While inversion events were observed to occurr on the (100)
surfaces, the loss of a complete surface coverage of \ce{Pt} because of the
refaceting from (100) to (111) makes exact characterization of such events more difficult.

of data collection while the right image (b) is taken at the end of six ns.
\ce{Pd} atoms are shown in pink and \ce{Pt} atoms are shown in gray.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Domain formation}
Using the same methodology as developed in reference \citep{Michalka:2015aa},
the surfaces of the systems were projected onto a two-dimensional grid which
was then digitized and analyzed to collect distributions of domain sizes of
\ce{Pd} and \ce{Pt}. An example of this process is illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:surfaceGrid}. Also of interest in this figure is the presence of a
small diamond-shaped patch of (100) \ce{Pt} sitting on top of the rest of the
\ce{Pt} surface. The distribution of domain sizes can then be plotted as a
function of time and \ce{CO} coverage as illustrated in Figures
\ref{fig:ds100Pt} and \ref{fig:ds100Pd}. This analysis was also run on the
(111) systems, and while the presence of inversion events does lead to a number
of ``small'' \ce{Pd} domains, the surfaces remain overwhelming \ce{Pt}, at
least during our simulation time.

distinct colors (right), while the distribution of the domain areas was collected
over 1.5 ns time windows.}
\label{fig:surfaceGrid}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

Figure \ref{fig:ds100Pt} identifies the strong effect \ce{CO} has on the size
of the \ce{Pt} domains on the 100-1Pt-2Pd systems. When no \ce{CO} was present,
the size of the domains are essentially the size of the entire system, the
presence of two distinct peaks is due to the binning and averaging that must be
done to display the data in this format. The 0.25 ML and 0.5 ML systems
conversely, do show significant changes over the 6 ns of data collection and
the decrease in \ce{Pt} domain sizes is matched, as expected by an increase in
\ce{Pd} domain sizes as highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:ds100Pd}.

Similar to the inversion events, one of the driving forces for this
reconstruction is the stronger \ce{Pd\bond{-}CO} interaction which encourages
\ce{Pd} exposure at the alloy surface. However, the primary cause for these
domain formations is the inherent instability of the (100) overlayer when
compared to the lower energ (111) surface. Nevertheless, the formation of
domains of the underlying \ce{Pd} exposed to the surface is of particular
interest because it opens up avenues for designing catalysts that could hide or
protect the active layer when not under reaction conditions.

\section{Summary}
The reconstruction that was observed on these systems was ultimately attributed
to the unstableness of the (100) surface facet rather than to any primarily
\ce{CO} induced effect. However, the presence of \ce{CO} did appear to
facilitate some of this reconstruction as shown in the domain plots and
inversion figures. Similar to what was seen in Chapter 3, the stronger
\ce{Pd\bond{-}CO} interaction coupled with the preference for \ce{Pt} to
maximize nearest neighbors provided the main driving force for these
reconstructions, but the presence of \ce{CO} also played a small role by
weakening the metal-metal bonds speeding up many of these processes. Future
simulations that ensure the stability of the bare surfaces may be able to speak
more clearly about the effects of \ce{CO} on these systems.

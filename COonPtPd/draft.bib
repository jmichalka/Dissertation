@article{Thostrup:2001dn,
	Abstract = {Through an interplay between density functional calculations, Monte Carlo simulations and scanning tunneling microscopy experiments, we show that an intermediate coverage of CO on the Pt(110) surface gives rise to a new rough equilibrium structure with more than 50\% step atoms. CO is shown to bind so strongly to low-coordinated Pt atoms that it can break Pt-Pt bonds and spontaneously form steps on the surface. It is argued that adsorption-induced step formation may be a general effect, in particular at high gas pressures and temperatures.},

@article{Batteas:1996rc,
	Abstract = {The chemisorption of sulfur and CO was found to have profound effects on the structure of a stepped platinum surface. By itself, sulfur chemisorbs, forming a p(2 x 2) ordered structure, and induces doubling of the terrace widths and step heights. Subsequent coadsorption of CO displaces the sulfur, compressing it to distances of root 3 times the Pt lattice spacing, and induces surface restructuring; New terraces form which contain exclusively CO and are separated by monatomic steps from the terraces containing the compressed sulfur overlayer. This coadsorbate induced restructuring phenomenon has strong implications in the mechanisms of surface catalyzed reactions.},

@article{Zhang:2007lq,
	Abstract = {We demonstrated that platinum (Pt) oxygen-reduction fuel-cell electrocatalysts can be stabilized against dissolution under potential cycling regimes (a continuing problem in vehicle applications) by modifying Pt nanoparticles with gold (Au) clusters. This behavior was observed under the oxidizing conditions of the O2 reduction reaction and potential cycling between 0.6 and 1.1 volts in over 30,000 cycles. There were insignificant changes in the activity and surface area of Au-modified Pt over the course of cycling, in contrast to sizable losses observed with the pure Pt catalyst under the same conditions. In situ x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy and voltammetry data suggest that the Au clusters confer stability by raising the Pt oxidation potential.},

	Abstract = {The slow rate of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is the main limitation for automotive applications. We demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for the ORR than the corresponding Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts for PEMFC. The Pt3Ni(111) surface has an unusual electronic structure (d-band center position) and arrangement of surface atoms in the near-surface region. Under operating conditions relevant to fuel cells, its near-surface layer exhibits a highly structured compositional oscillation in the outermost and third layers, which are Pt-rich, and in the second atomic layer, which is Ni-rich. The weak interaction between the Pt surface atoms and nonreactive oxygenated species increases the number of active sites for O2 adsorption.},

	Abstract = {In this article we describe further improvement of high-performance Pt monolayer-shell on carbon-supported Pd nanowires/nanorods-core electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This improvement is facilitated by electrochemical deposition of Pd nanostructured cores on functionalized carbon surfaces. We describe in some detail this first electrochemical deposition of Pd nanowires, including the effect of deposition parameters on the deposits morphology, and propose the mechanism of the Pd nanostructures growth. The one-dimensional growth of Pd is ascribed to the hydrogen-underpotential-deposition-mediated layer-by-layer deposition of Pd. The surface structure of deposited nanowires is composed predominantly of the {111}-oriented facets that facilitate the enhanced oxygen reduction and high stability of these electrocatalysts. They have significantly higher Pt mass-, and area- specific activities and performance stability under potential cycling conditions than commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, which indicates their great potential for resolving the remaining obstacles to commercializing PEMFCs.},

The clean Pd(111) structure is confirmed to be close to the ideal0 bulk structure. Slight, possibly hydrogen-induced deviations are obtained for the interlayer spacings down to the fifth layer: Δd12=+0.03$\pm$0.03 {\AA}, Δd23=−0.03$\pm$0.03{\AA}, and Δd34=Δd45=+0.05$\pm$0.03{\AA}(positive values indicate expansion from the bulk spacing value). The CO molecules are favored to adsorb at fcc-type hollow sites with the C-O axis perpendicular to the 0 surface. The optimal carbon-oxygen and metal-carbon bond lengths are 1.15$\pm$0.05 and 2.05$\pm$0.04 {\AA}, respectively. This is the first LEED structure analysis of CO adsorbed at a hollow site on clean metal surfaces without coadsorbates.},

@article{Conrad:1978fx,
	Abstract = {Adsorption, mutual interactions and transient product formation between oxygen and carbon monoxide on a Pd(111) surface were studied by means of LEED, UPS and isothermal as well as temperature-programmed desorption spectrometry at temperatures between 200 and 550 K. CO adsorption at 200 K was found to cause the formation of additional periodic overlayer structures above θ= 0.5, apart from the already known surface structures at θ{$<$} 0.5. Saturation is reached with a hexagonal close-packed layer at θ= 0.66 (≜1 ×1015moleculescm2). Depending on the sequence of gas exposure and on the partial coverages of COad andOad, different stages of coadsorption (island formation, ``compression''of the 2 ×2-Oad layer into a √3 ×√3 R 30$\,^{\circ}$structure, growth of a mixed phase with 2 ×1 periodicity etc.) may be distinguished, which influence the electronic properties and the reactivity of the adsorbates. At high surface concentrations CO2 formation proceeds with an appreciable rate already at 200 K, whereas at low coverages temperatures above 400 K are needed. The results demonstrate that no appropriate description of the kinetics of catalytic CO2 formation over the whole range of surface concentrations may be achieved in terms of simple rate laws involving coverage-independent rate constants (and activation energies) and mere surface concentrations of the reactants. There is on the other hand no indication for a reaction path involving the collision of a gaseous CO molecule with an adsorbed oxygen atom (Eley-Rideal mechanism), i.e. the reaction proceeds always with chemisorbed CO via Oad + COad →CO2 (Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism).},

@article{Bradshaw:1978uf,
	Abstract = {Combined IR reflection-absorption and LEED studies of the room temperature adsorption of carbon monoxide on the (100), (111) and (210) surfaces of palladium are reported. The CO stretch frequency on the (100) surface varies from 1895 cm−1 at low coverages to 1949 cm−1 at θ= 0.5. A further strong shift to higher frequency is observed during the compression stage for θ{$>$} 0.5. On the (111) surface the CO stretch frequency is found at 1823 cm−1 at very low coverages, rising to 1936 cm−1 at θ= 0.5. In the compression stage above θ= 0.5 a second peak is observed above 2000 cm−1. On the much more open (210) surface, where surface atoms with the next nearest neighbour distance of 2.73 {\AA}do not exist, the behaviour of the IR band resembles surprisingly that of the (100) surface. The infrared reflection studies provide detailed information on the CO/Pd system which other surface techniques have not as yet revealed, namely, evidence for surface specificity and localised site adsorption at low CO coverage. The frequency shifts observed in the spectra are discussed in terms of the three important intermolecular interaction mechanisms, namely, dipole-dipole coupling, direct intermolecular repulsion and indirect effects via the metal atoms.},

@article{Tao:2010,
	Abstract = {Stepped single-crystal surfaces are viewed as models of real catalysts, which consist of small metal particles exposing a large number of low-coordination sites. We found that stepped platinum (Pt) surfaces can undergo extensive and reversible restructuring when exposed to carbon monoxide (CO) at pressures above 0.1 torr. Scanning tunneling microscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy studies under gaseous environments near ambient pressure at room temperature revealed that as the CO surface coverage approaches 100%, the originally flat terraces of (557) and (332) oriented Pt crystals break up into nanometer-sized clusters and revert to the initial morphology after pumping out the CO gas. Density functional theory calculations provide a rationale for the observations whereby the creation of increased concentrations of low-coordination Pt edge sites in the formed nanoclusters relieves the strong CO-CO repulsion in the highly compressed adsorbate film. This restructuring phenomenon has important implications for heterogeneous catalytic reactions.},

All parameters are determined using both density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, as well as the necessary experimental data. Whereas current DFT implementations suffer from problems in predicting the correct adsorption site of CO on Pt{111}, the current MEAM potential quantitatively describes the adsorption energies on the Pt {100} and {111} surfaces.

	Abstract = {Single crystal adsorption calorimetry was applied to investigate the heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen and the reaction heats for the CO oxidation process on Pt􏰊111􏰋 at room temperature. Both sticking probabilities and heats of adsorption for CO and oxygen are presented as a function of coverage. These results are used to interpret the subsequent measurements taken for the CO oxidation process on the same surface. The initial heats of adsorption of CO and oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 are 180􏰛8 and 339􏰛32 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition the pairwise lateral repulsive interaction between CO molecules in a 􏰔􏰜3􏰙􏰜3􏰈R30$\,^{\circ}$ ordered layer at 􏰒􏰚1/3 is found to be 4 kJ/mol. A detailed Monte Carlo modeling of the dissociative adsorption and sticking probability of oxygen on Pt􏰊111􏰋 is performed. The initial rapid fall in heat is attributed to adsorption on defect sites, and subsequent adsorption on the planar 􏰊111􏰋 surface proceeds with a third neighbor interaction energy between the oxygen adatoms 􏰓3􏰌22 kJ/mol. When gaseous CO reacts with preadsorbed oxygen adatoms, the CO2 produced has an excess energy of 16􏰛8 kJ/mol. {\copyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics. 􏰎S0021-9606􏰔97􏰈02601-9􏰉},

	Abstract = {The desorption of CO from clean Pt(lll) and (loo), and from the same surfaces with par- tial overlayers of sulfur, was studied by Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy. The method of desorption rate isotherms was employed for data analysis. The desorption of CO from the (Ill) surface and both surfaces with ordered sulfur overlayers can be described as a first order process with coverage dependent activation energies. The desorption of CO from the clean Pt(100) surface is complicated by the dynamic interaction of the molecule with a thermally activated change of platinum surface structure. On both platinum faces surface sulfur decreases the initial binding energy of CO. As the CO concentration increases, its binding energy decreases very rapidly. This is due to a repulsive interaction which exists between co-adsorbed species.},

\begin{document}

The new \ce{Pd}-\ce{CO} potential energy function discussed in the
main text recovers the experimental $c(4 \times 2)$ surface structure
at high coverages.  In figure \ref{fig:C4x2}, we show that relatively
large domains of $c(4 \times 2)$ ordered \ce{CO} form on the surface.
The surface was prepared as a perfect \ce{Pd}(111) at 500~K, and was
dosed with a 0.5 ML coverage of gas phase \ce{CO}.  The system was
then cooled from 500~K to 130~K over 2~ns.  The domains and incomplete
ordering are a result of the rapid cooling.

    (outlined in cyan boundaries) of the $c(4 \times 2)$
    configuration. The surface started at 500~K and was cooled to
    130~K over 2~ns.  At this relatively high cooling rate, multiple
    domains with different orientations of the $c(4 \times 2)$ pattern
    are displayed.}

\newpage

The newly-fit \ce{Pt}-\ce{CO} potential energy function discussed in
the main text recovers the experimental
$(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}) R~30^{\circ}$ surface structure at a 1/3
ML coverage.  In figure \ref{fig:Root3}, we show that small domains of
$(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}) R~30^{\circ}$ ordered \ce{CO} form on the
surface.  The surface was prepared as a perfect \ce{Pt}(111) at 500~K,
and was dosed with a 0.33 ML coverage of gas phase \ce{CO}.  The
system was then cooled from 500~K to 130~K over 10~ns.  The small
domains and incomplete ordering are a result of the relatively rapid
cooling.

    surface started at 500~K and was cooled to 130~K over 10~ns.  At
    this cooling rate, small domains with different orientations of
    the $(\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}) R~30^{\circ}$ pattern are

An expanded version of figure 3 in the main text which contains data
for all five \ce{CO} coverage levels.

An expanded version of figure 4 in the main text which contains data
for all five \ce{CO} coverage levels.

\newpage

Figure \ref{fig:Pt_SI_small} contains data on the \ce{Pt} domains that
were $<$ 100 \AA\textsuperscript{2} in area.  Typical domains with
larger surface areas typically comprise 15-20\% of the total area,
while these smaller domains never reach 1\% of the total. These
domains correspond to 1-to-2 atom clusters of \ce{Pt} that exist
surrounded by \ce{Pd}. This situation can arise either from \ce{Pt}
adatom movement over the \ce{Pd} surface, or \ce{Pt}-\ce{Pd}
inversion.

    \ce{CO} coverages and at different times after exposure to

\newpage

In the surface alloys, the reconstruction involves mostly \ce{Pt} atom
motion, leaving the underlying \ce{Pd}(557) substrate mostly intact.
This is easily seen when the \ce{Pt} atoms in the left image below are
hidden.  The small amount of step-wandering and step-breaking of the
underlying \ce{Pd} highlighted on the right side of fig. \ref{fig:557}
shows the strong tendency of \ce{Pd} to maintain the (557) steps.
Additionally, the main deviations of the \ce{Pd} substrate observed
here appear to be tied to the locations of islands in the \ce{Pt} top
layer.

    $\sim$110~ns (\ce{CO} hidden). The right panel highlights the
    stability of the underlying (557) \ce{Pd} substrate after hiding
    the surface \ce{Pt} atoms. \ce{Pt} atoms are shown in gray and
    \ce{Pd} atoms are shown in pink.}

An expanded version of figure 5 in the main text which contains data
for all five \ce{CO} coverage levels.  The ordering of the coverages
is fairly well maintained, although the 0.25 and 0.33 ML curves cross
at a number of points.

\caption{Population of \ce{Pt} atoms with either 6 (solid), 9
  (dashed), or $\ge$ 10 (dot-dashed) \ce{Pt} nearest neighbors
  averaged over 18~ns blocks of time.  At $t = 0$, the majority
  (2/3) of \ce{Pt} is located in the (111) plateaus where
  the number of \ce{Pt} nearest neighbors is 6. The remaining \ce{Pt}
  is located at step edges, with a neighbor \ce{Pt} count of 5.}
